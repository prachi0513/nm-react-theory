ques3.What are React Hooks?
ans.React Hooks are functions that enable developers to use state and other React features in functional components. Introduced in React 16.8, hooks provide a more concise and readable way to write React components by allowing them to manage state and side effects without using class components.

Key Features of React Hooks
1.State Management: Hooks, such as useState, allow functional components to manage local state without the need for class components.

2.Side Effects: Hooks, such as useEffect, enable functional components to perform side effects, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or DOM manipulation, after rendering.

3.Context: The useContext hook provides a way to consume context within functional components, allowing for easier sharing of state between components.

4.Custom Hooks: Developers can create custom hooks to encapsulate logic and reuse it across multiple components, promoting code reuse and modularity.

ques4.Why do we need a useState Hook?
ans. To manage state and trigger re-render according to industry needs.
