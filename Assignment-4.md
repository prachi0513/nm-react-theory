ques1. Is JSX mandatory for React?
ans.No its not necessary because its not even a part of react but we uses as it mal=kes a upper hand at writing clean and human understandable code.

ques2.Is ES6 mandatory for React?
ans.No, ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) is not strictly mandatory for React, but it is highly recommended. React itself does not enforce the use of ES6, but using ES6 syntax and features can significantly improve the readability, maintainability, and efficiency of your React code.

ques3.What is <React.Fragment></React.Fragment> and <></> ?
ans.In React, <React.Fragment></React.Fragment> and its shorthand <></> are used to group a list of children elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. They are especially useful for returning multiple elements from a component’s render method without needing an additional wrapping element like a <div>.

Support for Keys and Attributes: <React.Fragment> can take key and other attributes, while the shorthand <> </> cannot.
Usage Context: Use <React.Fragment> when you need to add a key or other attributes to the fragment. Use <> </> for simpler cases where you don't need to add any props.

ques4.What is Virtual DOM?
ans.virtual dom is actual representation of a DOM which is used in react for diffing algorithms and other.
The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is an in-memory representation of the real DOM elements generated by a React component tree. It is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM that allows React to perform efficient updates and rendering.

ques5.What is Reconciliation in React?
ans.Reconciliation is the algorithm React uses to efficiently update the DOM by comparing the new Virtual DOM with the previous one, identifying changes, and applying only those changes to the real DOM.
here the diffing algo takes place which compare the new virtual DOM with the previous one and then updates the DOM accordingly.

ques6.● What is React Fiber?
ans.CAME IN REACT 16, React Fiber significantly enhances React's ability to handle complex and highly interactive applications by introducing incremental rendering, priority scheduling, and improved error handling. It provides a more robust foundation for building responsive, high-performance user interfaces and lays the groundwork for future advancements in concurrent rendering.

ques7.Why we need keys in React? When do we need keys in React?
ans.Because when the re-render came into picture to setfunction or states updates the diffing algo can actually check the changes using these keys so that its does not have to update the whole ui only ui new things nee dto be updated in re-render because whole re-rendering of componenets is a very expensive work.

ques8.● Can we use index as keys in React?
ans. if you have no keys then only you can use index otherwise its a big no but no keys is better than having index as keys.

ques9.What is props in React? Ways to
ans.props are like properties which we can pass to React components from one place to another and we catch them in components as props and use them.

ques10.What is a Config Driven UI
ans.config driven UI is that ui in which whole UI is dependent on the data we are receiving from the backend.
that is config driven UI.
